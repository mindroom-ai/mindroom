# MindRoom

> AI agents that live in Matrix and work everywhere via bridges.

- [Home](https://docs.mindroom.chat/): AI agents that live in Matrix and work everywhere via bridges.
- [Getting Started](https://docs.mindroom.chat/getting-started/): This guide will help you set up MindRoom and create your first AI agent.
- [Dashboard](https://docs.mindroom.chat/dashboard/): MindRoom includes a web dashboard for configuring agents, teams, rooms, and integrations without editing YAML files. Changes are synchronized to `config.yaml` in real-time.
- [Skills](https://docs.mindroom.chat/skills/): MindRoom uses Agno's skills system with OpenClaw-compatible metadata. Skills are instruction packs (a `SKILL.md` file) with optional scripts and references that guide agents without adding new code capabilities.
- [Plugins](https://docs.mindroom.chat/plugins/): MindRoom plugins add tools and can optionally ship skills. Plugins are loaded from paths listed in `config.yaml`.
- [Memory System](https://docs.mindroom.chat/memory/): MindRoom uses Mem0 for persistent memory across conversations. Memory is automatically enabled for all agents and uses ChromaDB for semantic search.
- [Voice Messages](https://docs.mindroom.chat/voice/): MindRoom can process voice messages sent to Matrix rooms, transcribing them and responding appropriately.
- [Scheduling](https://docs.mindroom.chat/scheduling/): Schedule agents to perform tasks at specific times or intervals using natural language. Tasks run in the thread where they were created.
- [Authorization](https://docs.mindroom.chat/authorization/): MindRoom controls which Matrix users can interact with agents.
- [CLI Reference](https://docs.mindroom.chat/cli/): MindRoom provides a command-line interface for managing agents.

## Configuration

- [Overview](https://docs.mindroom.chat/configuration/): MindRoom is configured through a `config.yaml` file. This section covers all configuration options.
- [Agents](https://docs.mindroom.chat/configuration/agents/): Agents are the core building blocks of MindRoom. Each agent is a specialized AI actor with specific capabilities.
- [Models](https://docs.mindroom.chat/configuration/models/): Models define the AI providers and model IDs used by agents.
- [Teams](https://docs.mindroom.chat/configuration/teams/): Teams allow multiple agents to collaborate on tasks. MindRoom supports two collaboration modes.
- [Router](https://docs.mindroom.chat/configuration/router/): The router is a built-in system component that handles intelligent message routing and room management. It decides which agent should respond when no specific agent is mentioned, sends welcome messages to new rooms, and manages various system-level tasks.

## Tools

- [Overview](https://docs.mindroom.chat/tools/): MindRoom includes 100+ tool integrations that agents can use to interact with external services.
- [Built-in Tools](https://docs.mindroom.chat/tools/builtin/): MindRoom includes 100+ built-in tool integrations organized by category.

## Architecture

- [Overview](https://docs.mindroom.chat/architecture/): MindRoom's architecture consists of several key components working together.
- [Matrix Integration](https://docs.mindroom.chat/architecture/matrix/): MindRoom uses the Matrix protocol for all agent communication. The integration is implemented in `src/mindroom/matrix/`.
- [Agent Orchestration](https://docs.mindroom.chat/architecture/orchestration/): The `MultiAgentOrchestrator` (in `src/mindroom/bot.py`) manages the lifecycle of all agents, teams, and the router.

## Deployment

- [Overview](https://docs.mindroom.chat/deployment/): MindRoom can be deployed in various ways depending on your needs.
- [Google Services OAuth (Admin)](https://docs.mindroom.chat/deployment/google-services-oauth/): This is the one-time setup for a shared Google OAuth app in MindRoom.
- [Google Services OAuth (Individual)](https://docs.mindroom.chat/deployment/google-services-user-oauth/): This guide is for one person running MindRoom and creating their own Google OAuth app.
- [Docker](https://docs.mindroom.chat/deployment/docker/): Deploy MindRoom using Docker for simple, containerized deployments.
- [Kubernetes](https://docs.mindroom.chat/deployment/kubernetes/): Deploy MindRoom on Kubernetes for production multi-tenant deployments.
