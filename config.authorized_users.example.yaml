# Example configuration showing how to control who can interact with agents
#
# Add this 'authorized_users' section to your config.yaml to allow additional users

# List of Matrix user IDs that agents will respond to
# If this list is empty or not provided, ONLY @mindroom_user:{current_domain} can interact with agents
authorized_users:
  - "@alice:example.com"       # Additional authorized user
  - "@bob:example.com"         # Another authorized user
  - "@admin:matrix.org"        # An admin from another server

# Notes:
# - @mindroom_user:{current_domain} is ALWAYS allowed (the main MindRoom user account)
# - Agents and teams from the config are always allowed to interact with each other
# - The router agent is always allowed
# - If authorized_users is empty/not provided, ONLY mindroom_user can interact with agents
# - User IDs must be full Matrix IDs in the format @username:domain
# - This restriction applies to all message types (text, voice, reactions)

# The rest of your config.yaml remains the same
