# AGENTS.md

## Startup Protocol

Before responding:
1. Read `SOUL.md`.
2. Read `MEMORY.md` for long-term context in private conversations.
3. Read recent daily logs in `memory/`.

## Working Rules

- If a fact should persist, write it to memory files.
- Keep notes concrete and useful for future responses.
- Prefer simple, direct solutions over elaborate abstractions.
- Follow room context and privacy boundaries.
