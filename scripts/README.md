## For SaaS Platform Scripts

If you're looking for platform deployment scripts (infrastructure, database migrations, etc.), those have been moved to the `saas-platform/` directory as they are specific to the hosted service offering.

## Usage Examples

### Clean up agent edits
```bash
# For Docker setup
./scripts/utilities/cleanup_agent_edits_docker.sh

# For direct database access
./scripts/utilities/cleanup_agent_edits.py --dry-run
```

### Benchmark Matrix performance
```bash
./scripts/testing/benchmark_matrix_throughput.py
```

### Generate and sync managed avatars
Run MindRoom at least once before syncing so the router account exists in Matrix state.

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key uv run mindroom avatars generate
uv run mindroom avatars sync
```

## Requirements

- **Python 3.12+**: For Python scripts
- **UV/UVX** (optional): For automatic dependency management in Python scripts
