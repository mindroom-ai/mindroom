# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2026-02-26

This Privacy Policy explains how MindRoom and related MindRoom clients/services handle information.

## Scope

This policy applies to:

- MindRoom services and documentation operated by MindRoom
- MindRoom client applications (including the iOS app)

## Information We Process

Depending on the feature you use, MindRoom may process:

- account identifiers (for example, Matrix user IDs)
- messages and files you send through your configured homeserver
- room metadata (room names, avatars, membership)
- app configuration and local preferences stored on your device
- diagnostic information you choose to share with support

## Matrix and Homeservers

MindRoom is built on Matrix.

- Message content, media, and account data are primarily stored and processed by the Matrix homeserver you use.
- If you use a third-party or self-hosted homeserver, that server's privacy policy also applies.

## iOS Permissions

The iOS app may request access to:

- **Microphone**: to record voice messages
- **Camera**: to capture photos/videos for chat attachments
- **Photo Library**: to select media to send
- **Photo Library Add Access**: to save media to your device
- **Local Network**: to connect to a local/self-hosted Matrix homeserver on your network

These permissions are only used to provide the corresponding app features.

## How We Use Information

We use information to:

- provide messaging and collaboration features
- deliver media upload/download and rendering features
- support account, authentication, and SSO flows
- respond to support requests
- improve reliability and fix bugs

## Sharing

We do not sell your personal information.

Information may be shared only as needed to:

- operate the service features you request (for example, with your configured Matrix homeserver)
- comply with legal obligations
- investigate abuse or security incidents

## Data Retention

Retention depends on the system component:

- data stored on Matrix homeservers is retained according to the homeserver operator's policies
- local app data remains on your device until you remove it or delete the app
- support emails and diagnostics may be retained for support and security purposes

## Account Deactivation / Deletion

The MindRoom iOS app provides an in-app account deactivation path:

- `Settings` -> `Account` -> `Delete / Deactivate Account`

Actual deletion/deactivation behavior depends on the capabilities and policies of your Matrix homeserver.

## Security

We use reasonable measures to protect information, but no system is completely secure.

## Children's Privacy

MindRoom is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction) without appropriate supervision and authorization.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date will change when material updates are published.

## Contact

- `support@mindroom.chat` (update if different before App Store submission)
