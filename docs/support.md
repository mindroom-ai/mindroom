- Confirm your account still has access to the room/content
- Include the homeserver URL and a screenshot if possible

### Account Deactivation

- Use the in-app path: `Settings` -> `Account` -> `Delete / Deactivate Account`
- If the flow fails, include the homeserver URL and any error message shown

## Abuse / Safety Reports

Use in-app report/block tools first when available.

If you need help with a moderation or safety issue and cannot use the in-app controls, email support with:

## Response Times

Support is provided on a best-effort basis. Critical account-access and safety issues are prioritized.
