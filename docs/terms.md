Last updated: 2026-02-28

These Terms of Service govern your use of MindRoom services and related MindRoom client applications (including the iOS app).

## Acceptance

By using MindRoom, you agree to these Terms.

If you do not agree, do not use the service or applications.

## Description of Service

MindRoom provides AI-agent and Matrix-based collaboration tooling, including client applications that connect to Matrix homeservers.

## Your Responsibilities

You agree to:

- use the service lawfully
- follow applicable platform rules and local laws
- respect other users and communities
- maintain the security of your accounts and devices

## Acceptable Use

You may not use MindRoom to:

- harass, threaten, or abuse others
- distribute illegal content
- violate intellectual property rights
- attempt unauthorized access to systems or accounts
- interfere with service operation or security

We may restrict access for abuse, security risks, or legal compliance.

## Matrix Homeserver Dependency

MindRoom clients connect to Matrix homeservers.

- Availability, retention, moderation, and account policies may be controlled by the homeserver operator.
- If you use a third-party or self-hosted homeserver, separate terms may apply.

## Open Source

MindRoom is open source, and source code for the app and related services is publicly available at `https://github.com/mindroom-ai`.

## Content and Moderation

You are responsible for content you send or upload.

MindRoom clients may provide reporting and blocking tools, but moderation outcomes can depend on the homeserver and room administrators.

## No Warranty

MindRoom is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, to the extent permitted by law.

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, MindRoom and its operators are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the service.

## Changes

We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use after changes are published means you accept the updated Terms.
